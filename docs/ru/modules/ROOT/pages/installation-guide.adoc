= Installation Guide

Installation of the Orchestrator plug-in is relatively straightforward.
This section will cover all the steps needed to acquire the code and begin using it within your project.

== Download plugin

To install the Orchestrator plugin, you must download it as a ZIP archive.

We recommend that you use the Godot Asset Library within the Godot Editor to search for Orchestrator.
This guarantees that the right files are downloaded, uncompressed, and placed in the right place in your current Godot project.

You can also obtain the ZIP archive directly from GitHub by going to the https://github.com/Vahera/godot-orchestrator/releases[Orchestrator releases] page.
This page lists each release with a list of downloadable assets for each released version.
The file you want to download is named `godot-orchestrator-<version>-plugin.zip`.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Godot Orchestrator development (dev) builds are not published to Godot's Asset Library.
Development builds are only available from the GitHub repository's releases page.
====

Whether you obtain the Orchestrator plugin from Godot's Asset Library or you download it directly from the releases page, the contents of the files are identical.
The ZIP will contain a single folder path called `addons/orchestrator`.
The contents of the ZIP file should be extracted directly into your Godot project root directory so that it is installed into `<project_root>/addons/orchestrator/`.

Once the addon is installed, restart the Godot Editor.

== New updates notification

When releases are published, you don't have to wait for the Asset Library to be updated with the new build information.
The Godot Orchestrator interface will directly notify you when an update is available in the top-right of the **Orchestrator** main view, shown below:

This check is performed at the start-up of the editor and every 12 hours thereafter.
The remote check is a call directly to the GitHub API.

When clicking the green button, you will be presented the following dialog window:

image::editor-download-update.png[Download update]

From here you can quickly browse the release notes available for the release on GitHub or click the **Download update** button for the update to be downloaded directly from GitHub.
Once the files have been downloaded, the contents of the `res://addons/orchestrator` folder will be replaced with the new version and the old plug-in directory will be moved to your operating system's recycle bin.

After installation, you will be prompted to restart the editor so the new plug-in version is activated.

== Enable plugin

As Orchestrator is based on Godot GDExtension, it is automatically enabled when the Godot Editor starts.
You will see it is enabled immediately as there will be a new module at the top of the Editor UI, shown below:

You can now safely navigate into the `Orchestrator` editor UI and begin using the plugin immediately.
