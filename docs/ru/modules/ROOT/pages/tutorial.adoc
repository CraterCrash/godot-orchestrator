= Tutorial

In this tutorial, we will walk through a simple example of how to set up an `Orchestration` to spin a cube each frame.

== Setting up the scene

Before we begin to set up the visual scripting aspects of our scene with Orchestrator, we actually first need a scene to work with.
For the purposes of this tutorial, we're going to create a 3D scene with a cube at the origin.

At the top of the Editor, select the `3D` module and then select the `3D Scene` option on the left to create a new 3D scene.
If you don't see this option, select **Scene > New Scene**.

This scene is not very exciting as it has no content, so let's add the cube that we want to rotate.
From the `Scene` tab, right-click on the `Node3D` root node and select **Add Child Node**.
This will open up a node selection dialog window.
Search for `MeshInstance3D` and select it.
Your Scene tree should look like the following now:

.Scene after adding MeshInstance3D

As we can see, there really isn't much in the viewport to look at yet, and that is because we have not yet assigned a mesh, aka the shape, that we want to draw.
Select the `MeshInstance3D` node in the scene tree if it isn't already selected, then on the right side in the Inspector Dock, click the button next to Mesh that reads "empty".
You should be presented with a drop-down menu and select `New BoxMesh`.
Your 3D viewport should look similar to this now:

The last thing we need before we begin writing our Orchestration is a Camera in the scene so that when we run the scene, we can see the cube being rotated.
In the Scene tab, select the root `Node3D` node, right-click and select **Add Child Node**.
Now search for `Camera3D` and select to add it.
Your scene tree should now look like this:

.Scene after adding Camera
image::tutorial-add-camera.png[Scene]

Now just before we go, we need to adjust the position of the Camera.
As you may notice in the 3D viewport, both the camera and the cube are both at the origin, or `(0,0,0)`.

To adjust the placement of the camera, you can use the 3D Gizmo or you can adjust the properties of the Camera3D node directly from the inspector.
With the `Camera3D` node selected in the scene tree, navigate to the Inspector Dock, expand the **Transform** section under **Node3D** and set the following properties:

.Camera properties
image::tutorial-add-camera-properties.png[Scene]

The camera is now set up.
You can toggle the camera's perspective by clicking the **Preview** checkbox in the top left corner of the viewport to see what the scene will look like when you run the game.
You can also hit **F6** to run the scene directly; however, Godot will ask that you save the scene before you can proceed.
Now with that done, lets jump into creating some visual scripting!

== Create the orchestration

At the top of the Godot Editor, navigate to the "Orchestrator" main view to create a new, empty orchestration.
If you still need to enable the Orchestrator plug-in within your project, please read the xref:installation-guide.adoc[Installation Guide].

.Steps to create an orchestration:
1. Click **File > New Orchestration** menu option from the Orchestrator main view toolbar.
2. Select a base type class, in our case it will be `Node3D`.
3. Provide a new orchestration file name, for this example use `rotate.os` and click `OK`.

At this point, the editor will show the file `res://rotate.os` in the **File List View**, and the main view's editor graph window will appear.
Additionally, the component view will appear and contain the default **EventGraph** graph.

The following shows what this should look like:

== Add nodes to node graph

An `Orchestration` is a visual representation of code using nodes in a graph to form logic.
Lets step through how to add nodes to the graph area to simulate rotating the cube.

=== Step 1 - Process Event

We want our cube to begin rotating right as the scene starts to play.
But more importantly, we want to continuously rotate the node each frame, and the way to handle that in Godot is to set up a per-frame handler, called a **Process Event** which represents a `_process` function call.

In the component view on the right, locate the **Override a Godot virtual function** button in the Function component's panel and click it.
This opens up a new **All Actions** dialog, which contains all available functions that can be overwritten.
In the search box type **Process** and you should see two options remain, **Call Physics Process** and **Call Process**.
For the purposes of this tutorial, we're going to use the **Call Process** option, so select that option.

A new **Process Event** node will be added to the graph area.
If you cannot find the node, you'll see that there is now a `_process` entry under **EventGraph** in the graph component view.
By double-clicking the `_process` item, the newly added node should be focused automatically.

This function acts as our entry-point, it will be what Godot calls to inform us to do our rotation logic each frame.
The node has two output pins, one execution and one data pin.
The execution pin is what defines the control flow of the graph, while the data pin defines some data that is being passed.
For the **Process Event**, this data pin passes the _delta_ time value that we'll use shortly.

=== Step 2 - Rotate Cube

We intend to attach this Orchestration to the `MeshInstance3D` node in the scene tree.
By doing this, we can call any function on ourselves to affect the cube we added to the scene earlier.

So in the graph area, click using the right mouse button to open the **All Actions** dialog window.
Using the search box, enter **Rotate Y**.
We're going to do a simple rotation of the cube around its Y-axis.
Select the **Call Rotote Y** action and a new node should be added to the graph.

This node looks a bit different from the **Process Event** we added in the previous step.

Most notably, this pin has 2 data input values, one with a label of **Target (self)** and another that is called **angle**.
The former allows this node to take an object reference to call the `rotate_y` function on that object instead.
For the sake of this demo, we're going to want to call that function on our self, so we will leave that pin disconnected.
The latter represents the angle in radians that which the cube should be rotated.

For now, in the text entry box next to the **angle** input, enter the value of `0.05`.
This sets a default, hard-coded rotation angle value.

=== Step 3 - Test it

The last step we need to do before we can test this Orchestration is that we need to attach the Orchestrator script to a scene node.
From the FileSystem Dock, drag the `rotate.os` file up into the Scene tree and drop it over `MeshInstance3D`.
You should see two things change in the scene tree when you do this:

1. A small document icon should toward the right, meaning a script is now attached.
2. The node's icon should change to the Orchestrator logo.

.After Attaching Orchestration to MeshInstance3D Node
image::tutorial-step-3.png[Step 3]

With the Orchestration attached, press the **F6** button to play the scene.
The editor will most likely ask that you save the scene, so provide a name for the scene.
Once the scene is saved, the Editor will begin to play the scene, and you should see the box rotate.

=== Step 4 - Environment

Now the fidelity and lighting is horrible, that's because we haven't added any environment.
Toward the middle of the toolbar on the 3D viewport, there is a an icon that looks like 3 white dots above one another.
By clicking on that icon, a popup appears.
On the left are settings for lighting and the right provides standard Environment settings.

1. Select **Add Environment to Scene**
2. Reopen the popup and select **Add Sun to Scene**

There should now be 2 additional nodes that are children of the root `Node3D` node in the scene.

If you hit **F6** to replay the scene, you should now notice that the cube and lighting look better.

=== Step 5 - Interpolate rotation

The final step we want to illustrate is interpolation.
In **Step 2**, we used the hard-coded value of `0.05` to control the rotation of the cube.
This isn't necessarily bad, but it's common practice to use interpolation in these use cases.

What we're going to do is expose a variable that can be set in the scene to control the speed of the rotation.
This will allow the same Orchestration to be used on different objects in the scene, and you can specify different rotation speeds for each.

==== Creating and exporting the `rotation_speed` variable:

1. In Godot, click on the `Orchestrator` tab at the top of the editor.
2. In the component view on the right, find and click the "+" button to add a new variable.
3. Click on the icon in the variables section and define a variable named `rotation_speed`.
4. Set the variable's data type to `Float` via the inspector, allowing the variable to store fractional numbers.
5. Mark the variable as "Exported" by checking the appropriate box.
This will make the `rotation_speed` variable public, allowing its value to be changed from within the editor's node inspector dock.

==== Using a variable in a graph:

1. Using the mouse, drag the `rotation_speed` variable from the component view onto the graph.
2. When you release the variable, select the "Get `rotation_speed`" option to read its value.

==== Converting degrees to radians:

1. OPen the "All Actions" dialog box in the graph by right-clicking on the graph area.
2. Type "Deg" in the search box to find the action "From degree to radians" (`Deg To Rad`).
3. Add the selected action to the graph.

==== Performing a mathematical operation:

1. Open the "All Actions" dialog box again, and search for "Multiply Float".
2. Find and add the "Multiply Float" action under the "Float" category to the graph.

==== Connecting nodes:

1. Connect the `delta` from the "Process Event" node to the input `A` of the "Multiply Float" node.
2. Connect the `rotation_speed` output to the input `B` of the "Multiply Float" node.
3. Connect the output of the "Multiply Float" node to the input of the "Deg To Rad" node.
4. Connect the output of the "Deg To Rad" node to the input port of the angle node `rotate_y`.

After completing all these steps, your graph will be correctly configured to read the value of the rotation speed, convert it from degrees to radians, and use the resulting value to rotate the object around the Y-axis based on the `delta` time.
This will ensure smooth rotation of the object in your scene.

Your graph should now look like the following:

.Graph
image::tutorial-step-5-graph.png[Graph]

If you hit **F6** to play the scene, you'll notice that the cube is not rotating.
This is expected because the variable's initial default value was left as `0`, so this means that we are not doing any rotation.

In the Scene tree, click on the `MeshInstance3D`.
You will see that there is now an Inspector Dock section called **rotate.os** and that there is a property **Rotation Speed** with a value of `0`.
Modify the property's value to `50` and rerun the scene using **F6**.

As you can see, the cube now spins.

[NOTE]
====
As an added exercise, you can add another `MeshInstance3D` to the scene, dragging the `rotate.os` file over the new mesh in the scene tree.
From there, set the value of **Rotation Speed** to something different from `50`.
If you rerun the scene you should be able to see the two nodes running with separate interpolation rates, but using the same code.
