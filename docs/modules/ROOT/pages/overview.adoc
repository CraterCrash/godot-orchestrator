= Overview

Orchestrator is a https://godotengine.org[Godot Engine,role=external-reference] plug-in that runs within the Godot Editor to design and implement a game logic using a graph-node visual-script-like system.

image::orchestrator-overview-example.png[Example]

The entire node graph is called an `Orchestration` and stored as a Godot resource within your project.
An orchestration can be loaded in the Editor to make changes to the flow and can be loaded at runtime to execute the behavior as part of your game.

An `Orchestration` is made up of `OrchestrationNode` resources, which represent each of the steps or nodes within the graph, and each node serves a unique purpose.
Orchestrator also permits custom node implementations to add to the existing behavior of the plug-in, which is discussed in the xref:orchestrator::custom-nodes.adoc[Custom Nodes] section.

== Editor configuration

The Godot engine provides functionality for editor plug-ins to directly integrate with many of its internal components, such as the `Project Settings` dialog available on the `Project` menu.

With the project settings dialog open, click the **General** tab and navigate near the bottom of the options left panel or simply using the filter settings widget and begin typing `Orchestrator`.
The plug-in allows you to define a number of features in this window including:

* A custom scene to use when running the orchestration from within the editor.
* Background, border, and title-bar colors used by different node types.

[NOTE]
====
If you have any suggestions for what other settings should be customizable, we welcome the feedback.
Please provide your suggestions on the project's https://github.com/Vahera/godot-orchestrator/issues/new/choose[GitHub] issues as a feature/suggestion.
====

== Editor integration

Orchestrator provides an in-editor interface, allowing you to quickly create and modify `Orchestration` resources using a drag-and-drop node visual-scripting-like interface.
To use the Orchestrator plugin, select the "Orchestrator" interface icon at the top of the Godot Editor, as shown below:

.Godot Editor Main View Selector
image::editor-top-ui.png[Editor Main View Selector]

Once you have selected the Orchestrator main view, you will see a similar view as shown below.
The editor does not initially show the editor graph.
You must create a new or open an existing orchestration using the `File` menu first.

.Orchestrator main view
image::editor-main-view.png[Editor Main View]

=== Grid / Graph editor

The grid or graph editor window on the right side of the main view is where you will spend most of your time interacting with orchestrations.
This is the view where you will drag nodes, configure node attributes, and connect nodes together to create a flow graph of nodes representing your desired behavior.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, no context menu or immediate node creation functionality is available on mouse right clicks, similar to the old Godot Visual Scripting behavior.
If you would like to see this added, please open a GitHub feature request.
====

=== File list

On the top left of the main view is the **Orchestration Files** list view.
This list view provides access to the currently open orchestrations inside the editor.
This allows you to open and manage multiple orchestrations concurrently freely.

.File List View
image::editor-main-view-file-list.png[Orchestration File List View]

To change between each opened orchestration, click on the orchestration file name in this list, and the orchestration graph panel to the right will update accordingly.

[TIP]
====
If several orchestrations are open concurrently, you can use the "Filter orchestrations" search box to limit the entries in the files list view to those that match the filter argument.
This can quickly help isolate a specific orchestration of interest without manually finding it within the list view.
====

=== Available Nodes

On the bottom left of the main view is the **Available Nodes** list view.
The Orchestrator plug-in maintains this list view, providing direct access to all `OrchestrationNode` implementations available by the Orchestrator plug-in or custom nodes provided by the currently opened project.

.Available Node View
image::editor-main-view-available-nodes.png[Available Nodes List View]

Each node _type_ in Orchestrator is organized into a category that best describes the functionality that the given node exposes for game logic purposes.
For example, an "if condition" node called `Condition` is categorized into a "Flow Control" category because, based on evaluating the condition, the logic flow may take one of two paths.

[NOTE]
====
We will discuss `OrchestrationNode` attributes such as naming and category in the xref:orchestrator::custom-nodes.adoc[Custom Nodes] section where we cover how to create project-specific custom nodes.
====

To work with these nodes, select a node from this list and drag the node onto the Orchestration's graph grid space.
Doing so, Orchestrator will create the specific node at the mouse's current position, and you can then safely configure and wire up the node with other nodes within the orchestration.

We will discuss each node and their actions in the xref:orchestrator::nodes.adoc[Basic > Nodes] section.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Unlike other Visual Scripting solutions, such as Godot 3's VisualScript language, Orchestrator focuses on higher abstraction with node behaviors rather than lower-level language constructs.
This difference enables faster development with a focus on reusable behaviors represented as nodes.
====

=== Running orchestrations in the editor

You can create and manage orchestration(s) within the editor and test the logic that your orchestration provides with a few simple clicks.
Orchestrator aims to provide a solid foundation for developing and testing your orchestrated game logic flows.

To run an orchestration from within the editor, open the **File menu** on the Orchestrator's main view toolbar menu and select the **Run** option, as shown below:

.Orchestrator File Menu
image::editor-main-view-file-run.png[Run Orchestration]

You can also use the hot-key mapping of `Shift` + `Ctrl` + `X` in order to execute the orchestration.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, orchestrations are not saved automatically before executing the `Run` command, so be sure that if you've made changes, you save the orchestration before running.
====

When running an `Orchestration` from within the editor, the plug-in will use the test scene found in `/addons/orchestrator/test` directory.

The editor will start a separate Godot game process that uses this test scene.
If you have configured your project with a main scene, the `Run` option will not use your main scene, and instead will use the test scene.

[NOTE]
====
Orchestrator cannot be configured to use a different test scene;  however, this is something that has been requested and will be added in a future build of the plug-in.
====

== In-game integration

Any Godot project can integrate with this plug-in using one of two methods:

* Use the `OrchestrationPlayer` scene tree node
* Using GDScript to interface directly with the `Orchestrator` singleton.

In this section, we're going to dive into the advantages of both.

=== Orchestration player

The `OrchestrationPlayer` node is an extension node provided by this plug-in that you can drop into any scene where you want to execute orchestrations.
The node extends Godot's `Node` contract, which makes it available for both 2D and 3D scenes alike.

To add an `OrchestrationPlayer` node to your scene, simply open the "Create new node" dialog window and search for `OrchestrationPlayer`.
You should see the following option available if the Orchestrator plug-in is currently enabled in your project:

image::editor-create-orchestration-player.png[Create orchestration player node]

With the node added to your scene, there are several attributes you can configure on the node.
By selecting the node in the scene tree, the following shows what options are available in the inspector:

image::editor-inspector-orchestration-player.png[Inspecting orchestration player]

In this view, you can set the `Orchestration` resource to be played along with whether the resource is to be auto-played or requires manual start using the `start()` method.
When the player enables auto-play, the `Orchestration` will be started when the player's `_ready()` function is called.

[TIP]
====
You can also use the `OrchestrationPlayer` directly from your own GDScript code, dynamically adding the player to your scene as needed.

Since the node's `_ready()` function dispatches the `start()` method when the node is configured with auto-play enabled, be sure that when setting the node's properties that you do so before adding the node to the scene to guarantee proper auto-play behavior.
====

If you would like to dynamically add the `OrchestrationPlayer` to your scene using GDScript, the following shows a simple example of how to do that with auto-play enabled:

[source,gdscript]
----
func _ready() -> void:
    var orchestration_player = OrchestrationPlayer.new() <.>
    orchestration_player.orchestration = "res://test/resources/test4.tres" <.>
    orchestration_player.auto_play = true <.>
    add_child(orchestration_player) <.>
----
<.> Construct a new `OrchestrationPlayer` instance.
<.> Assign the orchestration resource that should be loaded.
<.> Mark the player to start automatically.
<.> Add the player to the scene.

The following example illustrates adding the `OrchestrationPlayer` to the scene using GDScript, but in this case the player is not started automatically and is triggered instead by some other callback:

[source,gdscript]
----
var _orchestration_player : OrchestrationPlayer

func _ready() -> void:
    _orchestration_player = OrchestrationPlayer.new() <.>
    _orchestration_player.orchestration = "res://test/resources/test4.tres" <.>
    add_child(_orchestration_player) <.>

func _on_button_pressed() -> void:
    _orchestration_player.start() <.>
----
<.> Construct a new `OrchestrationPlayer` instance.
<.> Assign the orchestration resource that should be loaded.
<.> Add the player to the scene.
<.> Starts the orchestration when the button pressed signal is called.

=== Orchestrator singleton

At the foundation of the Orchestrator plug-in during a game's runtime is the `Orchestrator` singleton.
This autoload is enabled by the plug-in and is responsible for providing access to running orchestrations directly from GDScript with any scene element.

While we recommend to use `OrchestrationPlayer`, there may be times when embedding the plug-in inside an existing node's behavior is warranted, so utilizing the `Orchestrator` singleton for this use case is preferred.
The following illustrates just how easy it is to use the singleton in GDScript:

[source,gdscript]
----
@onready var _orchestration = preload("res://my_orchestration.tres") <.>

func _ready() -> void:
  Orchestrator.orchestration_finished.connect(_orchestration_finished) <.>
  Orchestrator.execute(_orchestration) <.>

func _exit_tree() -> void:
  Orchestrator.orchestration_finished.disconnect(_orchestration_finished) <.>

func _orchestration_finished() -> void: <.>
  # do whatever logic after orchestration finished
  pass
----
<.> Use `load` or `preload` to have the engine load the `Orchestration` resource.
<.> Connect the `orchestration_finished` signal callback.
<.> Disconnect from the `orchestration_finished` signal.
<.> Executes the orchestration using the `Orchestrator` autoload / singleton.
<.> Orchestration finished callback, called when the orchestration has completed.

[NOTE]
====
The `orchestration_finished` signal is often quite important for knowing when the orchestration ends when using the "show message" node or any other custom node that has some UI-level interaction that may rely on user input or span across multiple frames.
