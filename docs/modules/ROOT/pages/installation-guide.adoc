= Installation Guide

Installation of the Orchestrator plug-in is relatively straightforward.
This section will cover all the steps needed to acquire the code and begin using it within your project.

== Download plugin

To install the Orchestrator plugin, you must download it as a ZIP archive.
Installation can be done on the Asset Library using the **Download** button from the editor or web interface.

On GitHub, the Orchestrator plugin has https://github.com/Vahera/godot-orchestrator/tags[tags,role=external-reference] (versions); go to the https://github.com/Vahera/godot-orchestrator/releases[Releases,role=external-reference] tab and download the latest stable version.
This guarantees you're using a stable version provided by Vahera.

If you have trouble finding the **Releases** tab or picking a specific version _tag_, use the **Download ZIP** button to download a ZIP of the latest version, or use this https://github.com/Vahera/godot-orchestrator/archive/refs/heads/main.zip[link,role=external-reference] to obtain the ZIP archive.

Extract the ZIP archive and move the `addons/` folder it contains into your project folder.
If your project already contains an `addons/` folder, move the plugin's `addons/` folder into your project folder to merge the new folder with existing contents.
Your file manager may ask whether you wish to write into the folder; answer **Yes**.
This process will not overwrite any files.

== New updates notification

When releases are published, you don't have to wait for the Asset Library to be updated with the new build information.
The Godot Orchestrator interface will directly notify you when an update is available in the top-right of the **Orchestrator** main view, shown below:

This check is performed at the start-up of the editor and every 12 hours thereafter.
The remote check is a call directly to the GitHub API.

When clicking the green button, you will be presented the following dialog window:

From here you can quickly browse the release notes available for the release on GitHub or click the **Download update** button for the update to be downloaded directly from GitHub.
Once the files have been downloaded, the contents of the `res://addons/orchestrator` folder will be replaced with the new version and the old plug-in directory will be moved to your operating system's recycle bin.

After installation, you will be prompted to restart the editor so the new plug-in version is activated.


== Enable plugin

To enable the freshly installed plugin, open **Projects > Project Settings** at the top of the editor, then go to the **Plugins** tab.
This screen will show a list of installed plugins.
Find the line with `Orchestrator` as the name and click the **Enable** checkbox to enable the plugin.

Once the plugin is enabled, you will notice that a new Editor module exists at the top of your editor UI, as shown below:

You can now safely navigate into the `Orchestrator` editor UI and begin using the plugin immediately.
