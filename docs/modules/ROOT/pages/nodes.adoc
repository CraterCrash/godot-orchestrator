= Nodes

Orchestrator uses a node-graph to design complex behaviors called an `Orchestration`.
Each orchestration comprises at least three `OrchestrationNode` nodes, which provide specific behavior for the orchestration's interactions.
Each `OrchestrationNode` is organized into one of several _categories_.

[id="flow-control"]
== Flow control nodes

Flow control nodes are responsible for controlling the flow of an orchestration.
There are several different types of flow control nodes.

.Flow control nodes
image::flow-control-nodes.png[Flow control nodes]

The following sections will describe each flow control node in more detail.

=== Chance

A **chance** node provides a simple way to control the flow of an orchestration based on a percent chance calculation.

.Chance flow control node
image::flow-control-nodes-chance.png[Chance node]

The node's horizontal slider widget adjusts the output slot's percentage chance.
Placing the slider to the left sets the bottom output slot to 100% where the node will never pick the top output slot.
Similarly, placing the slider to the right sets the top output slot to 100% where the node will never pick the bottom output slot.

.Input slots
|===
|Input |Description

|(Unlabeled)
|The sequence input slot responsible for executing the node's chance calculation.

|===

.Output slots
|===
|Output |Description

|Upper
|The output path taken when the percentage chance is between 1 and the specified percentage.
If the value is 0%, the node path will never be taken.

|Lower
|The output path taken when the percentage chance is between (100 - percentage change) and 100.
If the value is 0%, the node path will never be taken.
|===

=== Condition

A **condition** node provides a convenient way to create a decision-based flow from a single true/false condition.

.Condition flow control node
image::flow-control-node-condition.png[Condition node]

When the node begins its execution, the condition will be evaluated as a _boolean_.
The output path taken depends entirely on whether the evaluated expression evaluates as _true_ or _false_.

.Input slots
|===
|Input |Description

|(Unlabeled)
|The sequence input slot responsible for executing the node's condition evaluation.

|===

.Output slots
|===
|Output |Description

|true
|If the condition is _true_, this output path is taken.

|false
|If the condition is _false_, this output path is taken.
|===

=== Random

A **random** node allows the orchestration flow to pick a random output path based on equal probability.

.Random flow control node
image::flow-control-node-random.png[Random node]

The horizontal slider adjusts the number of output possibilities dynamically.
Each possible output, up to a maximum of 10, has an equal chance of being chosen by the node.

.Input slots
|===
|Input |Description

|(Unlabeled)
|The sequence input slot responsible for executing the node's randomness evaluation.

|===

.Output slots
|===
|Output |Description

|Slots 1 to 10
|The output path taken based on the equal probability of picking a value between 1 and the number of possibilities.

|===

=== Repeat

A **repeat** node allows executing a series of nodes a specified number of times.

.Repeat flow control node
image::flow-control-node-repeat.png[Repeat node]

The node's spin-box allows for specifying the number of repeat iterations, up to a maximum of 10.
While iterations remain, the node will always take the _repetitions_ path; however, once reaching the maximum iterations, the node will end and take the _done_ output path.
The repeatable nodes should eventually loop back to the repeat node's input slot.

.Input slots
|===
|Input |Description

|(Unlabeled)
|The sequence input slot responsible for executing the node's flow control.

|===

.Output slots
|===
|Output |Description

|Repetitions
|The output slot that links to all nodes that should be executed the specified number of times.

|Done
|The output slot that is taken when the number of repetitions has occurred.

[id="logic"]
== Logic nodes

Logic nodes are responsible for executing different types of operations within an orchestration.
There are several different types of logic nodes available.

.Logic nodes
image::logic-nodes.png[Logic nodes]

The following sections will describe each logic node in more detail.

=== Expression

An *expression* node executes a single `GDScript` expression.

.Expression logic node
image::logic-node-expression.png[Expression node]

An evaluated _expression_ may return a result; however, the **expression** node does not use it.
After evaluating the expression, the orchestration's flow continues to the next node on the output path.

[TIP]
====
An **expression** node is great for assigning a value or calling a function on an _autoloaded_ singleton.
====

.Input slots
|===
|Input |Description

|(Unlabeled)
|The sequence input slot responsible for executing the node's expression.

|===

.Output slots
|===
|Output |Description

|(Unlabeled)
|The output path taken after the expression has been executed.

|===

=== Script

A **script** node calls a single method in a `GDScript` script instance.

.Script logic node
image::logic-node-script.png[Script logic node]

When executing a *script* node, the orchestration creates an instance of the specified script and calls the specified method.
Once the method ends, the script instance is released, and the orchestration advances to the next node.

.Input slots
|===
|Input |Description

|(Unlabeled)
|The sequence input slot responsible for executing the node's script.

|===

.Output slots
|===
|Output |Description

|(Unlabeled)
|The output path taken after the script method has been executed.

|===

=== Show Message

The **show message** node is responsible for presenting a dialogue screen, optionally allowing the user to select between one or more choices.

.Show message logic node
image::logic-node-show-message.png[Show message node]

This is one of the most complex nodes in the Orchestrator plug-in.
You can specify a custom scene to render the pop-up dialogue message, or the node will otherwise use the built-in default scene.

Additionally, you can specify multiple choices with an optional condition to control whether a specific choice should be available in the orchestration's logic.
When the user picks a specific choice, that specific output node's path is used.

.Input slots
|===
|Input |Description

|(Unlabeled)
|The sequence input slot responsible for executing the node's dialogue.

|===

.Output slots
|===
|Output |Description

|(Unlabeled)
|The output path taken after the message is shown.

|(Choice)
|The output path taken after selecting the specified choice.

|===

=== Wait

The **wait** node allows the executing orchestration to yield for a given time period.

.Wait logic node
image::logic-node-wait.png[Wait node]

The spin-box allows you to set the number of seconds the orchestration should yield.
This node can wait from a minimum of `0` seconds to a maximum of `60` seconds.

.Input slots
|===
|Input |Description

|(Unlabeled)
|The sequence input slot responsible for executing the node's wait.

|===

.Output slots
|===
|Output |Description

|(Unlabeled)
|The output path taken after the wait has finished.

|===

=== Wait For Action

The **wait for action** node allows the executing orchestration to yield until the specified input action has been pressed.

.Wait for action node

.Input slots
|===
|Input |Description

|(Unlabeled)
|The sequence input slot responsible for executing the node's wait for action.

|Output |Description

|(Unlabeled)
|The output path taken after the wait for the action press has finished.

[id="terminal"]
== Terminal nodes

Terminal nodes are responsible for controlling the start and conclusion of an orchestration.
There are only two different types of terminal nodes.

.Terminal nodes
image::terminal-nodes.png[Terminal nodes]

The following sections will describe each terminal node in more detail.

=== Start

A **start** node is responsible for declaring the starting point for the orchestration.

.Start terminal node
image::terminal-nodes-start.png[Start node]

As expected, a start node does not have an _input_ connection but only an _output_ connection.
When starting an orchestration, it looks for this specific node to know where the logic for an orchestration node graph starts.

[NOTE]
====
A start node is a special terminal node; only a single instance of this node can exist in an orchestration.
====

=== End

An **end** node is responsible for declaring the end point for an orchestration.

.End terminal node
image::terminal-nodes-end.png[End node]

As expected, an end node does not have an _output_ connection but only an _input_ connection.
When encountering an end node, the orchestration will end successfully.

[id="utility"]
== Utility nodes

Utility nodes are not meant to participate within an orchestration directly but instead are orchestration helper nodes.
There is only one type of utility node.

.Utility nodes
image::utility-nodes.png[Utility nodes]

The following sections will describe each utility node in more detail.

=== Comment

A **comment** node provides a way to document as part of the orchestration-specific parts of the flow graph.

.Comment utility node
image::utility-nodes-comment.png[Comment node]

You can populate the comment node's text box with an unbounded amount of text describing parts of the orchestration.
This node is not used during the execution of orchestrations and, instead, is used only during rendering of the orchestration in the editor.
