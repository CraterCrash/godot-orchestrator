    <description>
        This node provides the Orchestration with an implicit cast between two unique Godot types, such as between [int] and [String]. These nodes are automatically added when connecting two pins that are not compatible but can be coerced (cast to) the target type.
        [b]Deprecated:[/b] This node is now deprecated and no longer available. An [OScriptNodeTypeCast] node should be used instead to explicitly cast between two types, where needed.
        [i]This node is scheduled for removal in a future build of Orchestrator.[/i]
