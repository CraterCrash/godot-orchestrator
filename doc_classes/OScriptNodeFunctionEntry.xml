        Represents the entry point into a user-defined function graph.

    <description>
        When creating a function in an orchestration, the function's graph will contain one [OScriptNodeFunctionEntry] node, which is where control is passed into the graph when the function is called. The entry node consists of a single output control flow pin and zero or more output data pins, each which represent an input argument for the function graph.
        An [OScriptNodeFunctionEntry] node cannot be deleted like other nodes, and will only be removed when the containing function is deleted from the orchestration.
