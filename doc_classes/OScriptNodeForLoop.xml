        Performs a for-loop based on the difference between the start and end index values.

    <description>
        The [OScriptNodeForLoop] provides a simple for-loop mechanism, iterating from start to end, inclusive.
        The node begins iterating based on the [param start_index] pin's value, and continually increments the counter until it reaches the [param end_index] input pin. For each iteration, the node will send an output pulse to the [param loop_body] output pin, allowing your orchestration to perform logic for each iteration. Additionally, the node will output the current value of the loop index through the [param index] output pin. Once the loop reaches the [param end_index] input pin's value, the loop ends and outputs an impulse through the [param completed] output pin.
        Additionally, the [OScriptNodeForLoop] node can be toggled with a [param break] input pin when selecting the [code]For Loop with Break[/code] choice in the [param All Actions] window. The [param break] input pin allows the loop's iteration to be broken based on an impulse. The [param break] input pin is usually triggered by having a node in the [param loop_body] connecting its output control flow pin to the [param break] input pin. When control flow passes into the [param break] input pin, the for-loop exits immediately.
        [b]NOTE:[/b] When the for-loop breaks early, the node exits the [param aborted] output pin rather than the [param completed] output pin. If its unimportant that the loop exits early, connect both the [param completed] and [param aborted] output pins to the same node.
