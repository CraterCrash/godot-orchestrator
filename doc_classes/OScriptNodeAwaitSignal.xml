    <description>
        The [OScriptNodeAwaitSignal] node provides coroutine behavior to an orchestration.
        The node accepts two key input values, the [param target] pin specifies the object that will fire the signal while the [param signal_name] specifies the name of the signal to wait for. When this node executes, it registers a callback for the specified signal, and yields execution back to Godot. Only once the signal is fired will the orchestration resume; otherwise it continues to wait for the signal to be raised.
        This is quite useful if you need to submit a long-running task to a background thread without blocking the main engine loop. Once the background thread has completed the long-running task, it can schedule the signal to fire on the main thread, causing the orchestration to resume from where it left off.
