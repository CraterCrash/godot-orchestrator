        Frees the memory used by a Godot object.

    <description>
        The [OScriptNodeFree] node accepts a single [param instance] input value that represents the object to be freed.
        Godot provides two mechanisms for freeing the memory used by an object, they're the [method Object.free] and [method Object.queue_free] methods. The subtle differences on when to use one versus the other can be complicated to understand for newcomers, and [OScriptNodeFree] abstracts that subtle detail away such that you just need to worry with deallocating the object. Internally the node handles whether to use [method Object.free] or [method Object.queue_free] automatically.
