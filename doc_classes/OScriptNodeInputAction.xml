        The [OScriptNodeInputAction] node allows you to check whether a specific [InputEventAction] has just been pressed, released, or is pressed or released. The specific action to check is defined in the inspector with the [param action] property. The specific state or mode to check is defined in the inspector with the [param mode] property.
        In GDScript, this is the equivalent to:
        [codeblock]
        Input.is_action_just_pressed("ui_left")
        Input.is_action_pressed("jump")
        [/codeblock]
        See [InputEventAction] on how to define input actions in Godot.
