    <description>
        The sequence node may have two or more outputs, of which all are called as soon as the [code]Sequence[/code] node receives the input. They will always get called in order, but without any delay.
        [b]NOTE:[/b] See documentation for [OScriptEditablePinNode] for details on how to add/remove output pins.
