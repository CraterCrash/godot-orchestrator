    <description>
        Instantiating a scene in Godot requires multiple steps, which includes loading the scene resource as a [PackedScene] and then instantiating the scene using the [method PackedScene.instantiate] method. This process requires making sure that the scene resource is successfully loaded and that the scene can be instantiated.
        The [OScriptNodeInstantiateScene] node handles all the technical details for you. The [param scene] input pin specifies the name of the scene resource to be loaded. The [param scene_root] output pin specifies the root scene node of the detached loaded scene, which can be [code]null[/code] if the scene failed to load.
