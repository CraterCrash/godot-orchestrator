    <description>
        This node replaces the old [OScriptNodeCompose] implementation, allowing you to create [Variant] derived types based from various values.
        For example, this node allows the creation of a [Vector3] from its components of [code]x[/code], [code]y[/code], and [code]z[/code]. Additionally, other variants exist creating a [Vector3] from a [Vector3i] or another [Vector3].
        This node can be found in the [param All Actions] window using the keywords [code]make[/code], [code]create[/code], or [code]compose[/code].
