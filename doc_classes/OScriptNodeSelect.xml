    <description>
        The [OScriptNodeSelect] node accepts two inputs using the [param a] and [param b] input pins. When the [param pick_a] input pin is [code]true[/code], the value of [param a] is returned in the [param result] output pin. When [param pick_a] input pin is [code]false[/code], the value of [param b] is returned in the [param result] output pin.
        By default, the [OScriptNodeSelect] specifies that the [param a], [param b], and [param result] pins accept and output [Variant] types; however, you can customize the node to use a specific type by right-clicking any one of those pins. In the change pin type context-menu, select any available type to change the pin's type to limit what values can be connected to the pins.
