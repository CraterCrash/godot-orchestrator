    <description>
        The [OScriptNodeOperator] node is a mega node that takes one or two operands and performs a specific mathematical operation on the input values.
        For unary operations, a single input parameter named [param a] is used to pass the value into node. The node performs the operation and outputs the final result in the [param result] output pin.
        For binary operations, two input parameters named [param a] and [param b] are used to pass values into the node. The node performs the operation and outputs the final result in the [param result] output pin.
        [b]NOTE:[/b] The operation and argument types are determined when adding the operation node to the graph. If the operand types or operation need to change, you will need to add a new operator node to the graph.
