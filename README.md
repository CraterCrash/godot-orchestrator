# Godot Orchestrator

Orchestrator is the ultimate Visual-Scripting solution designed for Godot 4.2+ platform.
It revolutionizes Godot game development with its intuitive graph editor interface and hundreds of nodes to build any game logic.
This add-on empowers you to craft complex behaviors and intricate game logic with unparalleled ease and flexibility, just as you would find in other commercially available game engines.

Whether you are an experienced Godot veteran or an aspiring developer eager to get started with game development, Orchestrator is a must-have plug-in for any Godot project.

The following screenshots only scratch the surface of what the plug-in offers out of the box, with much more in future builds.

Orchestrator is made using Godot GDExtension technology, which has certain ABI (application binary interface) requirements that must be followed to guarantee that the integration between extensions and the engine work as expected.
The following table describes which Orchestrator version you should use based on your Godot editor version.

Using the wrong version of Orchestrator with the Godot editor may result in unexpected behavior or crashes.

| Godot 4.3+              | Godot 4.2             |
|-------------------------|-----------------------|
| v2.1.x+ (`main` branch) | v2.0.x (`2.0` branch) |
